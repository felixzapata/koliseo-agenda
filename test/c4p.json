Please use the field \"Comments\" if you have any specific requirement for your presentation.\n\n*This C4P closes on July 5* and we will take about one month to create the agenda, with the collaboration of our experts and communities.

We won't use your personal information for other purposes.\n\n*Codemotion Madrid won't pay for any talk, but will give the speakers coming from abroad a partial refund for the travel expenses*.\n\nPlease e-mail us at info@codemotion.es for any doubt.
